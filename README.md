## Overview
Diabetes, a chronic and life-threatening disease, presents challenges in timely identification. Leveraging machine learning, our project develops a predictive model for early diabetes detection. Five ML models were evaluated on the 'Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset,' resulting in Random Forest achieving 97.2% accuracy. Deployed via MySQL and Streamlite, our system offers a comprehensive web platform for user authentication, data storage, and interactive access to diabetes-related information. Our solution aims to enhance early intervention, reducing diabetes-related complications.
